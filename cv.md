## Work Experience

I have over three years of experience as a front-end developer. At my first job, I worked for almost 2 years and was developing React applications. After that, for about a year I worked as a mobile app developer for Android and iOS using Expo React Native. After that, I decided to return to web development and got a job in the company where I still work. I have extensive experience of working in a team and also have experience of developing the front-end side of the project on my own. During this time of work, I found a comfortable development stack for myself. It's React + Typescript + Redux Toolkit. But I'm still open to learning new development technologies.

## Education

In 2020, I graduated as a master's degree from Donetsk National Technical University (Faculty of Computer Science and Technology, Software Engineering).

## English level

According to the site [Ef Set](https://www.efset.org/ru/), my level of English is in the range from B1 to B2. I can use the documentation in English and know many terms related to IT and Web-development. I am still improving my English.
